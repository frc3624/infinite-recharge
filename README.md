### Oi Aryan Sharma, Director of Drive Team

We need to figure out button bindings which work for you guys while driving. Whenever you can, please make a sheet with all of your bindings which you want listed out.

Here's what he have so far:

- Basic Drive support with master/slave
- Intake works
- Super basic shooter
- Software Speed Shifting with 3 modes (Low, High, and Defense)
- Framework for Climb
- Cooling for Falcons
- Limelight subsystem
- Ball track and intake work, still need to finish up ball track's 5 limit switches :/

What we still need to do (probably longer than this list lol):

- PID for ball shooter
- Autonomous
- Get Limelight and PathViewer to work
- Use 2 controllers and decide on controls
- Make the robot climb

## Controls

**On the first Xbox Controller**

- Left Stick: (Move front and back) Right Stick: (Left and Right)
- Ball Shooter: A Button
- Ball Track Inwards: X Button
- Ball Track Outwards: Y Button
- Climb Button: B Button
- High/Low Speed Shift: Right Bumper
- Defense Shift: Left Bumper

**On the second Xbox Controller**

- Cool the Falcons: Left Bumper

To be determined...
