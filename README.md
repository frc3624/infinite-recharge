## 2021 Revision

This code was created for the [2021 FRC Infinite Recharge At Home Challenge](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2021/Manual/AtHomeManualSections/2021AtHomeChallengesManualSection02.pdf). The challenges we completed were: 

- (2.4.8)  Driving through predetermined paths as fast as possible
- (2.4.9)  Shooting balls from different zones in a game field
- (2.4.10) Shooting as many balls as possible in one minute

We did not complete all the challenges due to our robot missing hardware components to complete other challenges alongside a lack of time to implement autonomous navigation.

If you would like, you can use this code to control the robot, however, it is preferable to use the code from the [2020 Branch](https://github.com/frc3624/infinite-recharge/tree/2020) as it was designed for the entire robot and is much easier to troubleshoot.

Since you should not intend to use this branch for robot operation, and instead opt to utilize the the 2020 branch, the controls for the robot will not be listed in this file.
