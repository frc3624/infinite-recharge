# Infinite Recharge

## Latest Changes
We are cleaning. Our code is as clean as someone who hasn't had a drink in 50 years and is 49 years old. We have standardized our coding style

Here's what he have so far:

- Basic Drive support with master/slave
- Intake works
- Super basic shooter
- Software Speed Shifting with 3 modes (Low, High, and Defense)
- Framework for Climb
- Cooling for Falcons
- Limelight subsystem
- Ball track and intake work, still need to finish up ball track's 5 limit switches :/

What we still need to do (probably longer than this list lol):

- PID for ball shooter
- Autonomous
- Get Limelight and PathViewer to work
- Use 2 controllers and decide on controls
- Make the robot climb

## Controls

**On the first Xbox Controller**

- Left Joystick:    Forward + Backwards
- Right Joystick:   Left + Right
- Left Bumper:      Defense Gear
- Right Bumper:     High Gear
- Right Trigger:    Low Gear
- Y Button:         Climb Up
- X Button:         Climb Down

**On the second Xbox Controller**

- Right Joystick:   Move Control Panel Left and Right    
- DPad Up:          Intake Up
- DPad Down:        Intake Down
- B Button:         Run Intake Belt
- X Button:         Shoot Ball

Cooling Falcons will eventually become an automatic command, so we do not have a button allocated

To be determined...
