## 2021 Revision

This is being written as of the start of the 2021 Summer. A lot of this code will not be seen through, and this instead serves as an archive of our 2019-2020 Infinite Recharge Robot Code. The current version on GitHub was changed (poorly) for the 2021 Infinite Recharge At Home Challenges. Depending on Mr. Wilson's judgement on continuing work on this robot, we may never finish this robot, but this code remains.

## Latest Changes (As of March 2020)

We are cleaning. Our code is as clean as someone who hasn't had a drink in 50 years and is 49 years old. We have standardized our coding style

Here's what he have so far:

- Basic Drive support with master/slave
- Intake works
- Super basic shooter
- Software Speed Shifting with 3 modes (Low, High, and Defense)
- Framework for Climb
- Cooling for Falcons
- Limelight subsystem
- Ball track and intake work, still need to finish up ball track's 5 limit switches :/

What we still need to do (probably longer than this list lol):

- PID for ball shooter
- Autonomous
- Get Limelight and PathViewer to work
- Use 2 controllers and decide on controls
- Make the robot climb

## Controls

### On the first Xbox Controller

- Left Joystick:    Forward + Backwards
- Right Joystick:   Left + Right
- Left Bumper:      Defense Gear
- Right Bumper:     High Gear
- Right Trigger:    Low Gear
- Y Button:         Climb Up
- X Button:         Climb Down

### On the second Xbox Controller

- Right Joystick:   Move Control Panel Left and Right
- DPad Up:          Intake Up
- DPad Down:        Intake Down
- B Button:         Run Intake Belt
- X Button:         Shoot Ball

Cooling Falcons will eventually become an automatic command, so we do not have a button allocated

To be determined...
